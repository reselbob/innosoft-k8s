# Deployment Discovery Under Kubernetes


The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to have a service bind between alternate deployments

## Application Source Code

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const port = process.env.PORT|| 3000;
const color  = process.env.COLOR_ECHO_COLOR || "NO_COLOR";

const handleRequest = function(request, response) {
    const str = JSON.stringify({color, date: new Date()}, null, 4);
    response.writeHead(200);
    response.end(str);
    console.log(str);
};

const server = http.createServer(handleRequest);
server.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}, started at : ${new Date()}`);
});
```

## Lab Instructions

Go the `manifests` directory of the project. The `manifests` directory contains all the `yaml` files
we'll need to set up Red and Green deployments as well as the Kubernetes service that will bind to each accordingly.

**Step 1:** To go the `manifests` directory execute the following command:

`cd manifests`

## Set up the Red and Green Deployments

**Step 2:** Execute the following command to execute the Red deployment in your Kubernetes cluster

`kubectl apply -f red-deployment.yaml`

**Step 3:** Execute the following command to execute the Green deployment in your Kubernetes cluster

`kubectl apply -f green-deployment.yaml`

## Set up the Kubernetes service

**Step 4:** Execute the following command to execute the service in your Kubernetes cluster

`kubectl apply -f service.yaml`

## Confirm installation of Deployments and Service

**Step 5:** Execute the following command to confirm that the service is running under Kubernetes

`kubectl get services | grep echocolor`

**Step 6:** Execute the following command to confirm that the deployments are running under Kubernetes

`kubectl get pods | grep echocolor`

## Preparing to call the service

**Step 7:** In a new terminal window, start the Kubernetes proxy so we can access the service
via `curl`


## Find the NodePort IP address

**Step 8:** To get the NodePort IP, execute teh following command

`kubectl get services |grep NodePort`

**Step 9:** Get the master NodeIP address

`kubectl cluster-info`

**Step 10:** Call the service

`curl http://<MASTER_IP>:<NODE_PORT_IP>`

You should see similar output as follows:

```json
{
    "color": "RED",
    "date": "2019-07-23T04:07:15.857Z"
}
```

**Step 11** Changed the `service.yaml` manifest to look for pods that have the select, `color:green`.

This is the current version of `service.yaml`. Notice the entry, `color:red`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echocolor
spec:
  selector:
    app: echocolor
    color: red
  ports:
  -
    protocol: TCP
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort

```

Open `service.yaml` in the `vi` editor like so:

`vi service.yaml`

Strike the key, `i` to put `vi` into insert mode.

And then make the change to `color:green` as shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echocolor
spec:
  selector:
    app: echocolor
    color: green
  ports:
  -
    protocol: TCP
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
  type: NodePort

```

Strike the `esc` key to take `vi` out of edit mode.

Then strike the `:` key followed by `wq`.

Finally string the `enter` key to save the changes.

**Step 12** Now, reapply the manifest, `service.yaml` using the following command.

`kubectl apply -f service.yaml`

**Step 13** Run the `curl` command again:

`curl http://<MASTER_IP>:<NODE_PORT_IP>`

You should see similar output as follows:

```json
{
    "color": "GREEN",
    "date": "2019-07-23T04:07:15.857Z"
}
```

**Challenge** : Create and deploy a `yellow` deployment and adjust the service `echocolor` to use
the `yellow` deployment.
